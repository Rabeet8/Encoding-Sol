# Encoding Contract:

This Solidity contract offers practical functions for encoding and decoding various data types, including strings and numbers. It provides clear examples of utilizing "abi.encode", "abi.decode", and "abi.encodePacked" effectively.

# Features:

1) Combines strings: Efficiently concatenates multiple strings using abi.encodePacked.
2) Encodes and decodes numbers: Demonstrates basic encoding and decoding with abi.encode and abi.decode.
3) Encodes multiple strings: Shows how to encode multiple strings using abi.encode for later decoding.
4) Decodes multiple encoded strings: Illustrates the process of decoding strings encoded with abi.encode.
